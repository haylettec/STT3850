# Weight
```{r}
# For randomly selected samples of n = 16 men, what is the expected value of the sampling distribution of the sample mean?

# For randomly selected samples of n = 16 men, what is the standard error of the sampling distribution of the sample mean?
sigma <- 24

se <- 24 / sqrt(n)

# What would be the minimum sample size required to make the standard error of the sampling distribution of the sample mean less than 2.4?
# 2.4 = 24 / sqrt(n)
# 2.4 * sqrt(n) = 24
# sqrt(n) = 24 / 2.4
# sqrt(n) = 10
# sqrt(n)^2 = 10^2

# A typical U.S. driver puts approximately 13,500 miles on their personal vehicle each year. What is the probability that the total mileage (i.e., the sum of the daily mileage) for a car that was rented for a total of 289 days last year exceeds twice that amount?
